# LIRI Bot

#### LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.
#### It can take in four commands as follows:
#### 1. my-tweets:
  * This command shows all the latest tweets from your twitter.
